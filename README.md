# HeatMap-Project
An online application of a Heat Map generator based on the analysis of a user's Google Maps location history.
This application, was part of a big project development back in 2019-2020, that took place in the city of Patras,Greece, using the Location History files from the Google accounts of the city's university post-graduate students. 

The Google Maps service is used on the mobile phones of the users to offer navigation and spatial information search services. The settings of the Google account that they maintain on their mobiles allow the activation of the Location History service, according to which Google saves the user's current location in the cloud, with the aim of allowing the user to see, among other things, the history of their movements.

The data offered by this service have a special value both for the user himself and for the wider society. Under this application, each user will be able to voluntarily contribute their data to a common "smart city" repository and receive an analysis describing how environmentally friendly their commutes are.

The general idea behind the development of this app, was that it could be made possible for the administrator to witness the population level the routes the users choose to take, so that the urban infrastructure can be better designed, but also highlight the areas where the population is concentrated in the city of Patras, so that in case of emergencies, the planning of the dispatch of ambulances and fire brigades could be more efficient.

The software used during the development of this web application was : 

-- WampServer64 (3.1.9) , which is a Windows software stack that provides a local server environment for web development, combining MySQL/MariaDB (database) and various scripting languages such as PHP

-- phpMyAdmin ,  which is a web-based tool for managing these MySQL/MariaDB databases, allowing the developer to create, modify, and administer databases through an intuitive graphical interface
